# Phoenix AI
## What its about?
This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of an AI chat app built using ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and Appwrite. The app features real-time chat with an AI assistant, user authentication, and a responsive design powered by TailwindCSS.
It utilizes ReactJS for the frontend, Appwrite for backend services like authentication and database management, and the OpenAI API for AI-powered chat capabilities. To get started, Node.js, Appwrite, and a code editor are installed. 
The project is set up by creating a new React app, installing TailwindCSS, and integrating the Appwrite SDK. The app is built with user authentication using Appwrite, a chat interface styled with TailwindCSS, and AI integration for dynamic responses. 
Finally, the app is deployed for users to interact with the AI assistant in real-time. ðŸš€
